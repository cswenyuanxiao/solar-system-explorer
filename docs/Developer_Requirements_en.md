Data Modeling (example)
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Learning progress
CREATE TABLE learning_progress (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  module_id VARCHAR(50),
  progress_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
